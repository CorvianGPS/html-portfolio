<h1>The Best Movies According to Gabriel</h1>
<br />
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p>
  One of my favourite movies, had an interesting plot from the start all the way
  to the beginning.
</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>

<p>
  How it manages to make a biopic distinction between the creator of the atomic
  bomb and just another genius human being is incredible.
</p>

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>The amount of action and amazing characters on the screen was fantastic.</p>
